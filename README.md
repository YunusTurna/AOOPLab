Lunch Prep Application with Java

The main purpose of this project was to develop a program that suggests recipes based on the ingredients available at home. Of course, our project evolved, and we added a feature to display the nutritional values of the dishes. Following that, we included a feature to create random menus. Since we couldn't come up with more original ideas, we decided to conclude the project. Naturally, we would have liked to work with a larger database, but since this was a school project, we didn't require a large database, so we created our own.
